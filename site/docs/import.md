# Import

[FHIR OperationDefinition](https://pathling.csiro.au/fhir/OperationDefinition/import-2)

Pathling provides a [FHIR&reg; REST](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html)
interface, and the `$import` operation is an
[extended operation](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operations.html) defined on that
interface.

This operation allows FHIR R4 data to be imported into the server, making it
available for query via other operations such as [search](./search.html) and
[aggregate](./aggregate.html). This operation accepts the
[NDJSON](http://ndjson.org/) format, and links to retrieve that data are
provided rather that sending the data inline within the request itself. This is
to allow for large data sets to be imported efficiently.

Currently Pathling supports retrieval of NDJSON files from
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (`s3://`),
[HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html) (`hdfs://`) and
filesystem (`file://`) URLs. Authentication is supported for S3, see
[Configuration and deployment](./deployment.html) for details.

## Request

The request for the `$import` operation is a
[Parameters](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/parameters.html) resource containing the
following parameters:

- `source [1..*]` - A source FHIR NDJSON file containing resources to be
  included within this import operation. Each file must contain only one type of
  resource.
  - `resourceType [1..1] (code)` - The base FHIR resource type contained within
    this source file. Code must be a member of
    [http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/resource-types](http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/resource-types).
  - `url [1..1] (uri)` - A URL that can be used to retrieve this source file.

## Response

The response from the `$import` operation is an
[OperationOutcome](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationoutcome.html) resource,
which will indicate success or a description of any errors that occurred.

## Examples
